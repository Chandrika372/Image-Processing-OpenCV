# **Otsu's Thresholding Method**
--- 


Thresholding is the binarization of an image. We convert a grayscale image to a binary image, where the pixels are either 0 or 255.

For thresholding we can calculate the value of T using Otsu's method. 
Otsu's method assumes there are two peaks in the grayscale histogram of the image. It then tries to find an optimal value to separate these two peaks- the value of threshold T.
