# Gaussian Filter

Gaussian Filter also referred to as "Gaussian Blur" is a filter that is used in image processing for de-noising or removing noises form an input image. It can also be said that it basically blurs the image by using the "Gaussian Function".

It is a widely used effect in graphics software, typically to reduce image noise and reduce detail. The visual effect of this blurring technique is a smooth blur resembling that of viewing the image through a translucent screen, distinctly different from the bokeh effect produced by an out-of-focus lens or the shadow of an object under usual illumination. It is also one of the filters available in photoshop used for blurring.

The mathematics behind Gaussian Filter is convolving the image with the **Gaussian Function** which also expresses the _normal distribution_ in statistics. This function is used for calculating the transformation which is applied on each pixel of the image by convolving the image with a kernel of a particular size and sigma.

The one-dimensional function is expressed as

The two-dimensional Gaussian function is expressed as

where x is the distance from the origin in the horizontal axis, y is the distance from the origin in the vertical axis, and Ïƒ is the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution. When applied in two dimensions, this formula produces a surface whose contours are concentric circles with a Gaussian distribution from the center point.

**Graphically they are expressed as below**

In python ,Gaussian Kernel is defined either by Kernel size or sigma.
Here I have used **OpenCv** which is defined by Kernel-Size whereas in **skimage** sigma is used in Gaussian Filter.

Here I have used three ways for Gaussian-Filtering an image:

* cv2.GaussianBlur (the pre-defined function for blurring)
* cv2.getGaussianKernel (defining the kernel according to our need)
* Creating a Gaussian Function of our own
